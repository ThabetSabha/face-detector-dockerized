# FaceDetector

A small full stack web app that uses an api to detect faces in images submitted.
    
The front-end was built using React, while the backend was built using Express.
it uses Bcrypt to encrypt passwords, and Knex.js for querying the PostgreSQL database. 

PS. this was one of my first projects, so the code quality isn't that great.
